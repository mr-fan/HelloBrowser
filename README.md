# MarkupBrowserUpdate
Processwire's browser-update.org plugin

Adds the script from browser-update.org to the frontendpages before the </body> tag

Settings for browserversions are available, but the built in automatic from browser-update.org is recommended for normal usage.

For testing propose the output in frontend could set to 'true' so it shows regardless witch browser or version is used.
